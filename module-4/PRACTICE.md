# Practice

Build end-to-end training and inference pipelines using Airflow and Dagster.

### Key tasks

- Deploy Airflow with KubernetesPodOperator.
- Implement the same logic in Dagster.

## Task:

For this task, you will need both a training and an inference pipeline. The training pipeline should include at least the following steps: Load Training Data, Train Model, Save Trained Models. Additional steps may be added as desired. Similarly, the inference pipeline should include at least the following steps: Load Data for Inference, Load Trained Model, Run Inference, Save Inference Results. You may also add extra steps to this pipeline as needed.
