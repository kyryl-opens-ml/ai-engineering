Hey Maira, apologies for getting back to you so late—I just got back to Toronto after traveling.

This looks interesting. My proposed way to move forward is to run a feasibility study with the CEO and the team.

Timeline: 1 week  
Cost: $5k USD (+HST if this is a Canadian company)  
Output: A design document outlining step-by-step improvements to the product, with one of the 20+ screens modernized as an example.

That's the rough proposal, since it's hard to define the full scope without more information.

A couple of questions to help define it:


modernize +20 screens.
What do you mean by "modernize"? Any specifics would be helpful.

modernize +20 screens.
Modernizing 20+ screens does not sound complex; what would define the complexity and scope of this project is the underlying data structure. Do you have any insight into how convoluted the data schema is, the use-cases the product supports, and the number of active users?

Is there any way I can try the product myself?

Customers find it hard to use.
Are there any metrics or measurements to support this? What exactly is hard to use?

What has been tried and why did it fail?
How big is the tech team?
What is the structure of this team?

Is the plan to stay with PxPlus, or migrate to something more modern?

I will probably have more questions down the line—also, always happy to jump on a call with you or your Product CEO.
