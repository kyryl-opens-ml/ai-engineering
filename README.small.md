## History

Generative UI is probably the most underrated release from Google. 

It is how the future of software will look like, not dystopian "no more engineers in X years/months/days" - but highly personalized UX experience on demand running on top of your app - which is not even an app anymore but a platform to serve multiple generated UIs for each user.

If you haven't checked out this guide from OpenAI about the AI-Native SDLC, you definitely should.

TL;DR:

Clear stages: Plan, Design, Build, Test, Review, Document, Deploy and Maintain
Clear separation of responsibility: Delegate, Review, and Own

And there's a checklist for each! Very good, no-BS intro. Link in the first comment.
