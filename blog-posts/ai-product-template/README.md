## Goal: 

I want to build products fast! 
I want to use multiple agents to do this for me! 
I would prioritese simplicity and testing insatead pre-build features. 
I run 10s or maybe 100s of agents in cloud in parallel without them stepping on each oterhe foot! 

Long story short - I want to accelerate

How could I do this? 


## Stack:


TS + Vite for UI 
Python + FastAPI for API 
Supabase for Auth
Supabase for DB
Railway for Platform
Modal for ML 
Dagster for Jobs

And most importanta - AI engineerign first! What do I mean by this? 


## AI engineerign first

- Feature branches 
- Bullet proff testing
- Subgoal: run 10 agents in parallel 
- Anyone can edit it: slack, agetns, non tech 


## Basics

- minimal ui - done
- minimal api - done
- connect api + ui
- auth + user
- sidebar
-

## History: 

git commit -m "0. init app"

Please write me a simple FastAPI Python package in the @api folder.

Follow a structure like routes/models/db/etc.

But please keep it as simple as possible.
