# Agent Tech Lead

## About the Role

We're looking for an Agent Tech Lead to orchestrate and optimize AI coding agents at scale. You'll spend less time writing code yourself and more time architecting systems, planning work, and steering autonomous agents toward successful delivery.

## Responsibilities

- Define technical roadmaps and system architecture across short, mid, and long-term horizons
- Slice complex features into well-scoped tasks with clear expected outcomes
- Deploy, monitor, and steer multiple coding agents in parallel
- Establish engineering culture: testing standards, code style, and verification workflows
- Review agent outputs efficiently using integration and end-to-end tests
- Handle corner cases and intervene when agents get stuck
- Optimize infrastructure for multi-agent workflows (access, sequencing, feedback loops)
- Track agent success/failure rates to continuously improve processes

## You'll Thrive If You

- Have tech lead experience managing complex projects
- Think strategically about work decomposition and parallel execution
- Are comfortable treating software engineering like a strategy game—positioning units, unblocking - bottlenecks, and intervening tactically
- Can establish clear verification gates that make review fast and reliable
- Stay current with AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

# Mindset

Your "team" never sleeps and never gets tired - but sometimes fails spectacularly. Your job is to set them up for success and catch them when they don't.
